Project Plan for Application Development
The development of our application is structured into seven phases, each with specific objectives aimed at gradually building the solution. Given the complexity of the project, each phase is estimated to take 1-2 weeks. The initial phases may require additional time as we establish foundational components, but we anticipate increased efficiency as we progress.

Phase 1: Planning & Research
Duration: 1-2 weeks
Objectives:

Define System Requirements:
Identify user needs and business objectives.
Develop use cases and user stories.
Establish functional and non-functional requirements.
Select Technology Stack:
Choose programming languages, frameworks, and tools for frontend and backend.
Select cloud services and database solutions.
Plan for integration with Bluetooth beacons and other hardware.
Deliverables: Requirements document, technology stack decision matrix.

Phase 2: Backend Development
Duration: 1-2 weeks
Objectives:

Set Up Cloud Database:
Create database schema and establish cloud infrastructure.
Implement data storage, indexing, and retrieval mechanisms.
Develop API Endpoints:
Design RESTful or GraphQL APIs for data interaction.
Implement authentication and authorization protocols.
Create data validation and error-handling mechanisms.
Deliverables: Functional API endpoints, database schema, and technical documentation.

Phase 3: Bluetooth Beacon Integration
Duration: 1-2 weeks
Objectives:

Configure Beacons:
Select and configure Bluetooth beacons for required range and frequency.
Calibrate beacons for optimal performance.
Implement Scanning in App:
Develop functionality to detect and connect to beacons.
Implement data collection and transmission from beacons to backend.
Deliverables: Beacon configuration files, initial integration testing report.

Phase 4: Frontend Development
Duration: 1-2 weeks
Objectives:

Build UI for Sensor Display:
Design user-friendly interface for real-time sensor data visualization.
Incorporate responsive design principles for cross-device compatibility.
Integrate API and Bluetooth:
Connect frontend to backend APIs for data access.
Enable real-time updates and notifications from Bluetooth beacons.
Deliverables: Interactive frontend interface, integrated API, and Bluetooth functionalities.
