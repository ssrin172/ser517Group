Sprint Plan: Sprint 1

Objectives:
The primary goal of this sprint is to conduct foundational research, assess feasibility, and establish a clear vision for the beacon-based user tracking and alert system. Additionally, we will define system requirements, explore technical constraints, and finalize the mobile development framework.

1. Research, Feasibility Study, and Project Vision

Conduct an in-depth study of Bluetooth beacon technology (Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi, UWB) to understand its capabilities, limitations, and best practices for integration.
Research industry standards and protocols for indoor positioning to determine the most suitable approach for user location tracking.
Evaluate various cloud database solutions (Firebase, AWS IoT, Google Cloud) based on scalability, security, and ease of integration.
Identify potential challenges in beacon detection accuracy and propose strategies for mitigating interference and signal fluctuations.
Develop a formal project vision document, outlining the system's purpose, expected outcomes, key stakeholders, and long-term objectives.
Define key milestones, timeline, and resource allocation for future development phases.


2. Define System Requirements & Features

List core features of the application, including:
Beacon and sensor detection – Identify and list all nearby Bluetooth/Wi-Fi/UWB devices.
User location tracking – Estimate user coordinates based on beacon signals.
Cloud synchronization – Store and process user location data in real-time.
Privacy and security alerts – Notify users when they are near specific sensors.
User-friendly interface – Provide a clean and intuitive UI for system interaction.
Identify technical constraints and challenges, such as:
Beacon signal interference and accuracy issues in dynamic environments.
Latency concerns in cloud communication and real-time updates.
Security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized tracking.
Compatibility with multiple beacon standards (iBeacon, Eddystone, etc.).


3. Finalize Mobile Development Framework

Compare different mobile development frameworks (React Native, Flutter, Native Android/iOS) based on:
Performance and efficiency in handling Bluetooth/Wi-Fi communication.
Ease of integrating cloud services and databases.
Cross-platform support vs. native development trade-offs.
Community support, documentation, and long-term maintainability.
Select the most suitable framework and set up the initial project structure.


Expected Outcomes:

By the end of this sprint, we will have:
A comprehensive research report on beacon technology and cloud integration.
A well-defined project vision and roadmap for the development process.
A detailed list of core system requirements and identified constraints.
A finalized decision on the mobile development framework to be used for implementation.
