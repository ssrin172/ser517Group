Sprint Plan: Sprint 1

Objectives:
The primary goal of this sprint is to conduct foundational research, assess feasibility, and establish a clear vision for the beacon-based user tracking and alert system. Additionally, we will define system requirements, explore technical constraints, and finalize the mobile development framework.

1. Research, Feasibility Study, and Project Vision

Conduct an in-depth study of Bluetooth beacon technology (Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi, UWB) to understand its capabilities, limitations, and best practices for integration.

Research industry standards and protocols for indoor positioning to determine the most suitable approach for user location tracking.

Evaluate various cloud database solutions (Firebase, AWS IoT, Google Cloud) based on scalability, security, and ease of integration.

Identify potential challenges in beacon detection accuracy and propose strategies for mitigating interference and signal fluctuations.

Develop a formal project vision document, outlining the system's purpose, expected outcomes, key stakeholders, and long-term objectives.

Define key milestones, timeline, and resource allocation for future development phases.
