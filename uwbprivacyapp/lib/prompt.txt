I am working on a project. It is a privacy project. It involves the usage of Qorvo's ultrawide band beacons. This aim of this project is to aware the users about the sensors present in the room where the user is, and is tracking them/ taking the user data. When te user enters a room, the user's iphone gets connected to the UWB beacons present in the room. After this the user can see the list of sensor devices that are present in the room and are linked to the beacon.

 The application starts with a homepage that contains a welcome screen and a "start scanning" button. when the user clicks on the start scanning button, the application starts searching for the nearby ultrawide band beacons. if the beacons are found, our application tries to establish an initial 2-way handshake connection using bluetooth. The technology used here is Apple's Nearby Interaction. Once the beacons are connected, the beacon ids are retrieved and now using the beacons and iphone communication using apple nearby interaction, we try to get the distance of the user using the nearby interaction. using that distance we need to calculate the user coordinates and send a get api call to the backend sending the beacon ids. Now at the backend I already have sensor data which would be called using the beacon ids. This sensor data will be sent by the backend which would be containing all the data about the sensors linked to the beacon ids. This will contain the coordinates of the sensors(x,y) meaning where the sensors are placed in the room(hard coded values). there is a native ios file which contains the code for bluetooth connection between the phone and the beacons. It also has a file that contains the code to calculate teh distance of the user from each sensor device as we will get the user coordinates and each sensor coordinates. This file is in the ios folder and it communicates with flutter using method channel.
Now once I have the user coordinates and the sensor coordinates, I can calculate the diatance of the user from sensors and check if the user is in the tracking range of hte user or not.
