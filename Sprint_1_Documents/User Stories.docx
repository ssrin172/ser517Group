1. Research & Initial Planning
User Story: Conduct research on beacon-based location tracking
  As a development team, we want to research beacon-based location tracking technologies so that we can choose the most effective approach for our project.
Tasks:
  Explore different beacon technologies (Bluetooth, WiFi, UWB, etc.).
  Analyze accuracy, power consumption, and cost-effectiveness.
  Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies.

2. Feasibility Testing
User Story: Validate the feasibility of beacon-based tracking
  As a development team, we want to conduct feasibility tests on beacon-based location tracking so that we can ensure its accuracy and reliability.
Tasks:
  Set up initial test environments for beacon placement.
  Evaluate signal stability and accuracy in different locations.
  Identify limitations and propose enhancements.

3. Architecture Selection
User Story: Define the system architecture for location tracking
  As a system architect, I want to design the overall system architecture so that it supports efficient and scalable location tracking.
Tasks:
  Choose between centralized vs. decentralized architecture.
  Define interactions between devices, cloud, and sensors.
  Ensure scalability for handling multiple devices and sensors.
