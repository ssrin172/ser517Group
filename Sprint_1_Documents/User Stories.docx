1. Research & Initial Planning
User Story: Conduct research on beacon-based location tracking
  As a development team, we want to research beacon-based location tracking technologies so that we can choose the most effective approach for our project.
Tasks:
  Explore different beacon technologies (Bluetooth, WiFi, UWB, etc.).
  Analyze accuracy, power consumption, and cost-effectiveness.
  Identify potential challenges and mitigation strategies.

2. Feasibility Testing
User Story: Validate the feasibility of beacon-based tracking
  As a development team, we want to conduct feasibility tests on beacon-based location tracking so that we can ensure its accuracy and reliability.
Tasks:
  Set up initial test environments for beacon placement.
  Evaluate signal stability and accuracy in different locations.
  Identify limitations and propose enhancements.

3. Architecture Selection
User Story: Define the system architecture for location tracking
  As a system architect, I want to design the overall system architecture so that it supports efficient and scalable location tracking.
Tasks:
  Choose between centralized vs. decentralized architecture.
  Define interactions between devices, cloud, and sensors.
  Ensure scalability for handling multiple devices and sensors.

4. Tech Stack Selection
User Story: Select the appropriate tech stack for implementation
  As a development team, we want to select the best tech stack for our system so that we can ensure reliability, scalability, and ease of development.
Tasks:
  Choose suitable programming languages and frameworks.
  Select cloud platforms and database solutions.
  Evaluate third-party tools for beacon processing and communication.

5. Application Interface
User Story: Design the user interface for the application
  As a user, I want an intuitive interface that displays sensor details so that I can easily understand which sensors are monitoring me.
Tasks:
  Design UI/UX for mobile and web applications.
  Provide a map-based or list-based sensor visibility feature.
  Ensure accessibility and responsiveness.

6. Cloud Communication
User Story: Establish secure communication between beacon devices and the cloud
  As a development team, we want to send location data and beacon ID to the cloud so that the server can process it and provide sensor information.
Tasks:
  Develop secure API endpoints for communication.
  Implement authentication and data validation mechanisms.
  Ensure data integrity and error handling.
